#summary Analysis of our keyboard's speed vs the default Xbox keyboard..

=Overview=

Overall, results were very mixed. Some users performed better with Super Keyboard 9000, while other
performed better with the default Microsoft keyboard. Though we had a very small sample size, we did notice
some interesting trends. Experienced Xbox users tended to do better with the default Microsoft Keyboard, while
inexperienced users tended to do better with ours perhaps indicating that our keyboard was slightly more
intuitive for newcomers. Additionally, almost all participants improved their times with our keyboard to a
greater degree than they did with the Microsoft keyboard over the trials. This perhaps indicates that there is a
distinct learning curve to our keyboard. Our data doesnâ€™t positively indicate that we have created a faster
keyboard, but it does suggest that there is some merit to our overall design that is worth further pursuit.
